# Rust + DDD
Everything is inspired by an example from here

https://github.com/jdomenechb/rust-ddd-example

I just wanted to check how DDD looks in Rust environment, 
not by stupid run of the example, but rather by writing a simple example and thing about consequences.

## Run, Test, Debug.
I use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Looks like the best tool for writing, refactoring, debugging and testing.
